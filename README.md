### We want you to have a great experience playing our Quadruple war game, should you have any feedback feel free to contact us.

## Matching game involving Spanish vocabulary
## Objective
It's time to brush up on your Spanish vocabulary! Spanish words in jars will fall from the sky. Your mission is to match the word with the correct emoji. Be careful, though! If the jar reaches the bottom of the screen and has not been matched, the jar will be smashed on the ground and the preserves will be wasted! Can you save them all? If you smash 5 jars, the game is over and you'll have to try again.

### Game play
 - You will have approximately 10 seconds to match a jar name with its appropriate emoji to start. 
 - There will be more than one jar on the screen. New jars will appear intermitently so work quickly to match the jar name with it's appropriate emoji.
 - Jars will gently land on the bottom of the screen if matched with their proper emoji.
 - Careful! If a jar makes it to the bottom of the screen without being matched OR you click on an emoji that doesn't have a matching word on the screen, then that counts as one smashed jar.
 - You can smash up to 5 jars. Once the 5th jar is smashed, the game is over.
 - Thats' all you need to know for now. Have fun! Can you reach a new high score?
