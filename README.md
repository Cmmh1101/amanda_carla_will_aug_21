## Matching game involving Spanish vocabulary
## Objective
It's time to brush up on your Spanish vocabulary! Spanish words in jars will "cook." Your mission is to match the word with the correct emoji. Be careful, though! If the jar is fully cooked and has not been matched, the jar will explode and the preserves will be wasted! Can you save them all? If you smash 5 jars, the game is over and you'll have to try again.

### Game play
 - You will have approximately 20 seconds to match a jar name with its appropriate emoji before it cooks and explodes.
 - Careful! If the timer runs out without the jar being matched OR you click on an emoji that doesn't have a matching word on the screen, then that counts as one smashed jar.
    - You can smash up to 5 jars. Once the 5th jar is smashed, the game is over.
 - Thats' all you need to know for now. Have fun! Can you reach a new high score?

### Advanced details
 - You will receive up to 20 points for each correct jar guessed. The quicker you match the emoji to the word jar, the more points you get.
 - Bonus points for streaks are available! Get more answers correct in a row for bigger bonuses!
 - Save your lives for more bonus points!
 - How high can you get your high score?
