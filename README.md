## Matching game involving Spanish vocabulary
## Objective
It's time to brush up on your Spanish vocabulary! Spanish words in jars will fall from the sky. Your mission is to match the word with the correct emoji. Be careful, though! If the jar reaches the bottom of the screen and has not been matched, the jar will be smashed on the ground and the preserves will be wasted! Can you save them all? If you smash 5 jars, the game is over and you'll have to try again.
